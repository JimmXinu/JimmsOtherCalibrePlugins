# KOReader

This is my personalized extension to Calibre's User Defined USB driver.

It pokes a couple of things in KOReader's files to yield 'better' behavior as I define it.

`patches` contains my KOReader patches, here because I didn't want to bother with another repo at this time.

As usual, stuff in this repo is my personal use stuff.  If it helps you, great!  But I won't be interested in supporting any of it.
